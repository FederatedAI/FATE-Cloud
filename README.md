## Overview ##
As an infrastructure for building and managing Federated Data Collaboration Network, FATE Cloud is the first industrial-grade Federated Learning Cloud Service. 

FATE Cloud enables FATE to be managed in multi-cloud, forming a secure federated data network, designed to provide a secure and compliant data cooperation solutions across or within organizations, and provide an enterprise-level federated learning productivity application solution.

FATE-Cloud provides standard federated infrastructure implementation capabilities, technical support capabilities, a unified federated site management mode and the whole process service, and addresses the problems of management collaboration, data processing and authentication, low cooperation efficiency, and poor interaction among different organizations.

## Major features ##
FATE Cloud is composed of Cloud Manager, which is responsible for federated site management, and FATE Manager, a site client management terminal. It provides registration and management of federated sites, automated cluster deployment and upgrades, cluster monitoring, and permission control and other core functions. 

**Federated Cloud（Cloud Manager）**

Cloud Manager is the management center of the federated network, which is responsible for the unified operation and management of FATE Manager and each site, monitors the services of the site and Federated cooperation modeling, performs the federated permission control, and ensures the normal operation of federated data cooperation network.

**Federated Site（FATE Manager）**

FATE Manager is responsible for the management and maintenance of their respective federated sites, providing services such as a site joining the Federation Organization, automatic deployment and upgrade of a site, monitor of the federated cooperation modeling and cluster services of a site, and management of user roles and application permissions of a site, etc.

## Deploy ##
Cloud Manager is deployed as a separate service. As long as the deployed server has jdk8 environment and MySQL connection configuration is correct, the service can run normally. 

FATE Manager is a separate application and does not rely on any FATE service. FATE Manager in v1.0 supports the rapid deployment of FATE through KubeFATE. Therefore，before deploying FATE with FATE Manager，please ensure that MySQL and [Kubernetes](https://github.com/FederatedAI/KubeFATE/blob/master/k8s-deploy/README.md) cluster have been deployed. 

For more detailed deployment information，please refer to FATE Cloud Deployment([Cloud-Manager](./cloud-manager/deploy/doc/Cloud-Manager部署文档.md) and [FATE-Manager](./fate-manager/deploy/FATE-Manager_Install_Guide.md)).

## Usage ##
After deployment，please prefer to "[FATE Cloud product manual](./docs/FATE-Cloud产品使用手册v1.0.pdf)" for detailed usage of FATE Cloud.
